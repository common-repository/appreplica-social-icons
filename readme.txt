Appreplica Social Icons lets you add icons for all the popular social networking sites to your posts, page and widgets.

== Description ==

Appreplica Social Media Icons lets you add icons for all the popular social networking sites to your posts, page and widgets. They can individually be linked to any local or external URL and you can control their size, colors and spacing. Select from dozens of predefined icons or upload your own custom icons. We designed this free plugin as a complement to our [Appreplica Social Embeds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/appreplica/) plugin so that you can embed your social media content using icons instead of just menu items.
